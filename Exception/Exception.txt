Exception  =  Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of code, typically at runtime. 

Exception Handling  =  Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException,
                       SQLException, RemoteException,  



Importatnt  =  if  we  dont use  try catch block  and if  erro  occure it   wll  block the  whole  execution of the  program. if  we  use try catch  rigth   
                and  erro  occure  it  will not  bock  the  other  ecetion only  that  perticular part    will  give   error  and  it   will not 
                 afftect  other thing 





The key difference between these two scenarios is that the try-catch block allows the program to handle the exception and continue executing, while without the try-catch block,
 the program terminates immediately with an exception message.
