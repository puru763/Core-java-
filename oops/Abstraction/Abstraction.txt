Abstraction  is sued hide an implementation details      

example =  in restaurant   we  order   food   we  dont  know  who  is chef  and  what  Ingredient   they  gonna use   so this  si an  abstract 
          only necesary details  will be  given  them    

Importatnt  = IN this we need to unertsnd that  interfec and abstract class both a re used for abstraction (used to  hide an imlementation details)
                abstract   class  can have  both  abstract  and  non  abstract   menthod     but  method   which is  declared  as  abstrct  in  abstract 
                 class  need to   be  overrride  (impelmt  the logic)  in  sub  class    

Abstract Classes: Can have both abstract and non-abstract (concrete) methods.

Interfaces: Can have abstract, default, and static methods.
